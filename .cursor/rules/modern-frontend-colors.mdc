# Modern Color Principles

## Color Systems & Palettes
- **60-30-10 Rule**: A balanced approach to color distribution.
  - **60%** Dominant/Primary color (often a neutral).
  - **30%** Secondary color.
  - **10%** Accent color (for CTAs and highlights).
- **Color Schemes**: Use the color wheel to create harmonious palettes.
  - **Complementary** (opposite colors): Maximizes contrast, good for drawing attention.
  - **Analogous** (adjacent colors): Creates a harmonious, cohesive look.
- **Color Scale**: Define light and dark variants for each hue in your palette (e.g., using HSL modifications or a predefined scale like `blue-100`, `blue-200`...). Limit the total number of distinct hues to avoid visual clutter.

## Best Practices
- **Contrast Ratios**: Ensure text is readable. The WCAG minimum is **4.5:1** for normal text and **3:1** for large text. Use tools like the WebAIM Contrast Checker to verify. This benefits all users, including the ~8% with color vision deficiencies.
- **Design Tokens**: Define all colors as design tokens (CSS variables or theme variables in a framework). This ensures consistency and makes theming (e.g., dark mode) trivial to implement.
  ```css
  :root { --color-primary: #0065A9; }
  ```
- **Backgrounds & Accents**: Use neutral colors for backgrounds. Avoid pure white text on dark backgrounds to reduce glare; use a light gray instead. Use your accent colors purposefully for interactive elements.
- **Meaning & Culture**: Be mindful that colors have functional and cultural meanings (e.g., red for urgency/error, blue for trust).
