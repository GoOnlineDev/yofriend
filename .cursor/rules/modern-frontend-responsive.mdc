# Modern Responsive & Adaptive Design Principles

## Core Concepts
- **Fluid Grids**: Use relative units (e.g., percentages, `vw`) for layouts, allowing them to stretch or shrink with the screen size.
- **Flexible Images**: Use CSS to ensure images and media scale proportionally within their containers, preventing overflow. A common technique is `max-width: 100%;`.
- **Media Queries**: Apply different CSS styles based on device characteristics like screen width, allowing the layout to change at specific **breakpoints**.

## Mobile-First Approach
- **Strategy**: Design for the smallest screen first, then progressively enhance for larger screens.
- **Benefits**: Prioritizes core content, encourages performance optimization, and leads to a cleaner, more adaptable design.

## Responsive vs. Adaptive
- **Responsive**: A single, fluid layout that continuously adjusts to any screen size. This is the most common and flexible approach.
- **Adaptive**: Uses a set of predefined, fixed layouts for specific screen sizes. The design "snaps" to the best-fitting layout at certain breakpoints.

## Standard Breakpoints
Use these as a starting point, but always let your content determine the final breakpoints.
- **Extra Small Mobile**: 320px - 480px
- **Small Mobile (Landscape)**: 481px - 600px
- **Small Tablets**: 601px - 768px
- **Large Tablets**: 769px - 1024px
- **Small Desktops**: 1025px - 1280px
- **Large Desktops**: 1281px - 1440px
- **Extra Large**: 1441px+

## Progressive Enhancement
- **Strategy**: Start with a baseline of content and functionality accessible to all users (using semantic HTML), then layer on more advanced presentation (CSS) and functionality (JavaScript) for capable browsers.
