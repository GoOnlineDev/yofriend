# Platform-Specific Design Guidelines

When building cross-platform applications, be aware of each platform's design language to make your UI feel more native. You can either blend conventions or adapt the UI for each platform.

## Material Design (Google)
- **Used On**: Android, Web (Google services).
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Grid**: 8dp grid for spacing and layout.
  - **Theming**: "Material You" theming engine adapts colors from the user's wallpaper.
  - **Typography**: Roboto is the standard font family.
  - **Elevation**: Uses shadows to indicate layers and depth.
  - **Interaction**: Components have prescribed interactions, like the ripple effect on buttons.
- **React Library**: **MUI** (formerly Material-UI).

## Fluent Design (Microsoft)
- **Used On**: Windows, Microsoft 365, Teams.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Materials**: Uses effects like Acrylic (blur) and Mica to create a sense of depth.
  - **Light & Shadow**: Emphasizes lighting effects.
  - **Typography**: Segoe UI is the standard font family.
  - **Motion**: Distinct and fluid animations for sliding, fading, and revealing content.
- **React Library**: **Fluent UI React**.

## Apple Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)
- **Used On**: iOS, macOS, iPadOS.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Clarity, Deference, Depth**: Core principles. The UI should be clear and defer to the content.
  - **Typography**: San Francisco (SF) is the standard font family.
  - **Tap Targets**: Requires larger minimum tap targets (at least 44x44 points).
  - **Controls**: Uses standard system controls like segmented controls and bottom tab bars.
  - **Navigation**: Often uses a navigation stack or tab-based navigation.
- **Note**: There is no official Apple-sanctioned React component library, so developers often build custom components that mimic the HIG.
